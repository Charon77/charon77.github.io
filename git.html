<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>When you work alone, writing software, all you need to do is write the code,
compile it, and run it, and you’re set. But what if you are working in a team?
How do you share what you’re typing with others? Do you send your code by email?
Cloud storage? What if there’s a mistake that happens later on in the project’s lifespan,
can we figure out what introduces the bug, and even who to <em>blame</em>?</p>
<p>As your project scales, things are getting more difficult. You now start working
in a team of five people, per se. Each of them work on different parts of the project.
For instance, one person could person on one particular feature of an app, corresponding
to several files, while the others could be working on different files. Sometimes, several
people could be editing different or even same part of a single file, like the main page of
a mobile app, or the css of a website.</p>
<p>We need some sort of system that could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easily distribute code between people</li>
<li>Merges codes with little conflicts as possible</li>
<li>Tracks changes so we know when did anyone made changes, to which files, and why</li>
</ul>
<p>Git solves that.</p>
