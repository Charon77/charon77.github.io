Markdown - Spend More Time on Writing, Not Formatting
======================================================

Back to [Index](index.html#-markdown-markdown-html-)


Motivation
-----------

Imagine writing website pages like how you normally would: a bunch of
html, links here and there, css files spread all over. Then, maybe some
point in live you decided to use frameworks, such as bootstrap. Things
do not go well, when you have to edit pages after pages one by one, adding
bootstrap css files to each header, assigning classes to `<div>` and what-not.

Wouldn't it be nice if we can spend more time **actually** write content, and
not figuring out where the closing `</div>` tags are?

Markdown solves this problem.

Markdown, on the other hand contains just the document and a few other things;
not much. This is so unlike html documents which contains lots unimportant text
that are not content, but have to be there in order to have _nice display_.

What is it?
-----------

Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
you view it on a browser (like Firefox) or using text editor (like Notepad).
This allows even visitors that uses ancient PCs for _surfing the web_ to access
our website.

Even today, people still favor Markdown for its readability (when viewed as a plain text)
and its simplicity.

Let's take a look at a couple of examples.

Example
-------

A typical html document would look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.min.css"/>
  </head>
  <body>
  <h1 id="markdown">Markdown
  </h1>

  <h2 id="what-is-it-">What is it?
  </h2>

  <p>Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
  you view it on a browser (think: website) or using text editor.
  This means that you can open any markdown files with programs
  such as notepad, and still be able to read it easily, as opposed
  to reading (.html) files.
  </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you are familiar with html, you know immediately that what's really
important is just the heading: **`Markdown`**, the sub-heading, **`What is it?`**, and
the body of the paragraph surrounded by `<p>...</p>`.

Now, let's compare it to Markdown.

A typical Markdown document looks like this.
```

Commonly used Markdown
----------------------
This section is based on [this][1] and [this(pdf)][2], which are really useful
for starters learning how to use Markdown for the first time.

Other exhaustive Markdown resources are also available, ranging from 
different flavors of Markdown, one of which being gfm (GitHub Flavored Markdown), etc.

Here are some of the basic Markdown example to get started.

### Headings
Two main ways of writing headings.
1.  Using \# followed by space before the heading.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    # This is heading 1
    Some text.
    ## Heading 2
    ### Heading 3
    ...
    ###### Heading 6
    More text!
    ```
    
    Which yields to:
    
    > # This is heading 1
    > Some text.
    > ## Heading 2
    > ### Heading 3
    > ...
    > ###### Heading 6
    > More text!
    
2.  Using = or - at the _bottom_ of the heading.
    
    Personally, I prefer this method as it looks clearer in plaintext.
    You can use this format **only** for Heading 1 and Heading 2. For
    levels below it, revert to the \# format.
    
    **Example:**
    ```
    Heading 1
    =========    
    Some text over here.
    
    Heading 2
    ----------
    
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.*
    ------------
    
    *Note: in some parser, the line below the heading must not be shorter
    than the text. This demonstrates what happens when this is violated.
    Even though it appears well here, it's use is discouraged. Besides, it
    looks bad.
    ```
    
    > Heading 1
    > =========    
    > Some text over here
    > 
    > The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
    > --------------------------------------------
    > 
    > The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
