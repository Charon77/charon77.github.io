Hello, and welcome.

First of all, thank you for reaching this page. I am really excited for
what I am sharing with all of you.

We often try to learn something, looking at tutorials everywhere, and
sometimes, they are just too complicated. I'm sure you all have felt that too.
As it turns out, in my experience, things are not supposed to be _that_ hard.
Developers often write not just bad code, but also bad documentations, as well
as bad tutorials. As we progress, we realize that things are _super_ easy, once
you got the hang of it. Things will get easy after you know the reasoning behind
their design, how they are structured, their motivation, as well as their design
philosophy. I really hate it when easy things seem complicated to newcomers.

That is why I've gathered a collection of "tutorials". Personally, I don't want
them to be called tutorials. Think of them more like _toys_; something you play
and have fun with. While you need to know how they work and why they are made like
that, there's essentially no goals other than to be able to play them. These _toys_
are something you can try easily to get you up and running based on my personal
experiences and from the websites I've stumbled upon. I really want to share the
thinking experience, so that you feel accomplished after playing with soem of them.

Here you will find list of programs, tools, or even concepts. Inside each of them,
you will find summaries of what they are, why should / shouldn't you play with them,
as well as instructions on how to use them; what they can and cannot do.
These documents are not made for full-fledge references, but more as a guide book,
as well as tips and tricks that may not seem obvious at a glance.

I really hope these articles would help you start out something fresh and fun,
without the intimidating fear of difficulties.
