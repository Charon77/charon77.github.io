We encounter many things in life. 
Yet, a lot of them resides nowhere but in our brains.
Our interaction with people allows us to tell stories of ourselves,
our experiences, our past, values, opinions... the list goes on.

We learn new stuffs, and long as we keep them in our puny brains,
they will dissapear as time goes on. Today, as I write this, marks
the day I, as a person, realises the importance of writing and sharing
knowledge I have with others.

In the following pages, you will find things that I learn so far, mainly
in the field of Computer Science, as well as other things.

I truly wish through these texts, I could shed some lights about
the experiences I encounter as I learn.
