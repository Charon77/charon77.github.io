It's been a while since the last time I posted something here. I figure many
of you are probably having the same struggle as me: you just started your own
blog, you wanted to write everyday, and being **extremely** ambitious about your
blog, and suddenly you stop. And forgot about it. And maybe you start going to
YouTube or Facebook or whatever you use these days, and before you know it,
your blog is dead. Once you realized it, you're thinking like: no one was going
to read my blog anyway.

When I make this post, I have no idea what I'm gonna write about, but I know
that I need to write something, and sometimes I'm just stuck. So in this post,
you'll find with me what it takes to keeping a blog up. This post is gonna be
about how to figure out what to write and how, and also some tips and tricks
on how to keep your blog running, instead of writing on it once and let it
collect dust. It's worth mentioning that I have _no idea_ how this post gonna
turn out, and I'm going to research as I write.
