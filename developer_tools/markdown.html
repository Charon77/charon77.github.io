<p>Have you ever wanted to make a blog?</p>
<p>We all do. Yet, making websites is not for everyone. Some of you
might already be using Wordpress or Blogspot. But they do come
with their own cost: they’re a bit tricky to configure, and they’re
an overkill if all you need is writing content.</p>
<p>What if you want to spend <strong>less</strong> time setting up Wordpress,
or configuring Blogspot, and <strong>more</strong> on <em>actually</em> writing content?</p>
<h5 id="if-you-can-write-in-notepad-you-can-make-a-blog-">If you can write in Notepad, you can make a blog.</h5>
<p>And I’m going to show how with all of you right now.</p>
<p>In this article you’ll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Markdown, and how it makes anything easier</li>
<li>How to write in Markdown (it’s very easy, I promise.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next article, you will also learn
how to publish websites for free with Github, so that
you can share the link to everyone else in the world! <em>(coming soon)</em></p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>You’re an aspiring writer. Maybe you want to tell people how well
that sushi restaurant you just visited, or you want to review a brand new
camera of yours.</p>
<p>You wanted to write something that people can share on Facebook, you want
to put pictures in it, and you need to be able to write it anywhere
you bring your computers to.</p>
<p>For some of you <em>tech savvy</em> readers, you might just write in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.
But what if, maybe, you don’t know how to write in HTML? Maybe you
don’t have time to learn it, and to be fair, HTML is <em>kind of</em> complicated. Some
even argue: <strong>CSS is the worst</strong>.</p>
<p>But here’s the deal. If you have no idea what <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>
are, don’t worry, we won’t be needing them.</p>
<h6 id="to-reiterate-with-markdown-we-can-finally-spend-more-time-actually-writing-content-">To reiterate: with Markdown, we can finally spend more time <strong>actually</strong> writing content.</h6>
<h4 id="how-does-markdown-do-anything-differently-">How does Markdown do anything differently?</h4>
<p>Unlike the more difficult HTML or CSS, Markdown, on the other hand contains <strong>just</strong>
the document and nothing else. This is achieved by having <em>markups</em> that looks
natural to the human eyes (hence the name Markdown).</p>
<p>Despite that, Markdown is powerful enough to do <em>some formatting</em> to make pretty
websites. In fact, this blog is written with Markdown. Don’t believe me? You can
check the source Markdown for this article (or any other articles) by changing
the link in the address bar from <code>.html</code> to <code>.md</code>
(or, you know, click <a href="markdown.md">this</a>).</p>
<p>Formally speaking, markdown files <code>.md</code> are documents that are <em>easy to view</em>, whether
you view it on a browser (like Firefox) or using text editor (like Notepad).</p>
<h6 id="let-that-sink-in-for-a-moment-">Let that sink in for a moment.</h6>
<p><img src="../img/stock/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-surprised-cat-scottish-straight-closeup-isolated-on-white-background-499196506.jpg" alt="surprised kitty" title="Rawrr"></p>
<p>With Markdown, you can see a website <em>nicely</em> even with just a text browser.
This is <em>sooooooo</em> unlike HTML, which looks gibberish to the untrained eyes.</p>
<p>Today, people favor Markdown for its readability (when viewed as a plain text)
and its simplicity. This allows even visitors that uses ancient PCs for <em>surfing the web</em> to access
our website.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a couple of examples.</p>
<h6 id="a-typical-html-document-would-look-like-this-">A typical html document would look like this:</h6>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>

    <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
    you view it on a browser (think: website) or using text editor.
    This means that you can open any markdown files with programs
    such as notepad, and still be able to read it easily, as opposed
    to reading (.html) files.
    <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

<p>If you’re unfamiliar with HTML, you might struggle to read the content it’s trying
to present. Computers, on the other hand, will happily format them for you.</p>
<p>It’s not a problem until you realize that <em>you too</em> have to read and <strong>write</strong> in
HTML. Even web developers have trouble reading long lines of HTML.</p>
<p>Now, let’s compare it with Markdown, using the same content.</p>
<pre><code>Markdown
========

What is it?
-----------

Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view,
whether you view it on a browser (like Firefox) or
using text editor (like Notepad).
This allows even visitors that uses ancient PCs
for _surfing the web_ to access our website.
</code></pre><p>Which one would <strong>you</strong> rather read (or write)?</p>
<p>See how different it is between the two? The former (HTML) contains lots
of so-called “HTML Tags” decorating the whole document. While easier
for computers to read, we struggle to understand what the document is
about.</p>
<p>The latter (Markdown) looks much simpler and easier to read. There’s no
doubt even first-timers would have no difficulties understanding
what the document is about.</p>
<p>That being said, Markdown is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for HTML, rather a
<em>teeny-tiny</em> subset of it. However for most people that needs to write,
Markdown is enough, and you don’t need sophisticated tools to understand
its content.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>As simple as it is, you need to <em>write</em> in Markdown to get familiar with
it. While you don’t really need any tool for that, you might find it
more satisfying to see your Markdown <em>magically</em> turns to pretty texts.</p>
<p>Here are some online editor for you to quickly try Markdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://markdownlivepreview.com">http://markdownlivepreview.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor">https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you can’t try them now, don’t worry. This article provides sample
Markdown and results, so do follow along.</p>
<p>The first step would be to familiarize yourself. If you have never seen
Markdown before, don’t be ashamed. It is a somewhat old format (but not forgotten).
Make sure to have a good look on how Markdown looks like in the
section above.</p>
<h5 id="markdown-tries-to-be-as-close-as-plain-text-as-possible-">Markdown tries to be as close as plain text as possible.</h5>
<p>When trying Markdown, it is important to keep this in mind. When you
encounter something you need to do, and you don’t know how to do it, think: how
would you write it in Notepad it so that it looks nice?</p>
<p>Therefore, don’t take Markdown as another language, but rather as a way you should
<strong>always</strong> write in plain text</p>
<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>
<p>Headings are important. It catches attention from the reader, provides 
clue about what your writing is about, but most importantly: it is the
first thing anyone sees.</p>
<p>Now I’ve said before that Markdown tries to be as close as plain text as possible.
Keeping that in mind, how would you write a title in order to distinguish it
from other texts?</p>
<p>We’ve seen from the example that this can be achieved by writing the title
and putting underline below it.</p>
<p>In Markdown, you can write headings like this.</p>
<pre><code>Title
=====

Lesson 1
--------

Here are some text in the first line of your blog.
</code></pre><p>which gives the following result:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="title">Title</h1>
<h2 id="lesson-1">Lesson 1</h2>
<p>Here are some text in the first line of your blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds neat! You now know how to make <code>headings</code>! Do you see how natural
it becomes to write in Markdown?</p>
<p>Note how the Title uses <code>=</code> while the Section Header uses <code>-</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s dig deeper.</p>
<p>Headings marks the beginning of a section.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two</strong> ways to make headings.</p>
<h4 id="first-way-equal-sign-or-dash-sign-at-the-_bottom_-of-the-heading-">First way: Equal sign <code>=</code> or Dash sign <code>-</code> at the <em>bottom</em> of the heading.</h4>
<p>Putting equal signs <code>=</code> marks the text above to be displayed in <code>h1</code> or the
largest heading. A dash sign <code>-</code>, on the other hand, displays the text above
in <code>h2</code>, which is smaller.</p>
<h5 id="example-">Example:</h5>
<pre><code>Heading 1
=========    
Some text over here.

Heading 2
----------

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
--------------------------------------------

*Note: in some parser, the line below the heading must not be shorter
than the text. This demonstrates what happens when this is violated.
Even though it appears well here, it&#39;s use is discouraged. Besides, it
looks bad.
</code></pre><h5 id="result-">Result:</h5>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="heading-1">Heading 1</h1>
<p>Some text over here</p>
<h2 id="heading-2">Heading 2</h2>
<h2 id="the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog-">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I prefer this method as it looks clearer in plain text.
However, you can use this format <strong>only</strong> for Heading 1 and Heading 2.
For levels below it, rever to the # format below.</p>
<h4 id="second-way-hashes-can-also-be-used-before-the-heading-">Second way: Hashes <code>#</code> can also be used before the heading.</h4>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>If you put any sort of symbol before a text, you would easily find it,
as you only need to skim through the first character.</p>
<p>In Markdown, this is useful when your heading is more than two levels deep,
as <code>=</code> and <code>-</code> can only be used for level 1 and level 2 respectively.
Hashes can mark headings from 1 to 6, depending on how many hashes
do you use.</p>
<h5 id="example-">Example:</h5>
<pre><code># This is heading 1
Some text.
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
...
###### Heading 6
More text!
</code></pre><h5 id="which-yields-to-">Which yields to:</h5>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="this-is-heading-1">This is heading 1</h1>
<p>Some text.</p>
<h2 id="heading-2">Heading 2</h2>
<h3 id="heading-3">Heading 3</h3>
<p>…</p>
<h6 id="heading-6">Heading 6</h6>
<p>More text!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note how the first and second heading looks <strong>exactly</strong> the same.</p>
<p>Using equal signs <code>=</code> below the heading <em>is</em> identical to using one <code>#</code>.</p>
<p>Using dash signs <code>-</code> below the heading <em>is</em> identical to using two <code>#</code>.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>How would you write paragraphs, say, in a word processor? You separate
them with <code>enter</code>.</p>
<p>Rules for Paragraphs:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or several lines of text becomes a single paragraph</li>
<li>A blank line separates paragraphs.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate, let’s take a look on these examples.</p>
<pre><code>This section demonstrates paragraphs
that are written
across multiple lines. The quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

This sentence sits on a new paragraph, because of the
empty line that comes before it.
</code></pre><p><strong>This will yield:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This section demonstrates paragraphs
that are written
across multiple lines.  The quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
<p>This sentence sits on a new paragraph, because of the
empty line that comes before it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s that easy!</p>
<h2 id="links">Links</h2>
<p>When we write documents, mainly websites, linking other pages is important.
Markdown provides various ways to write links.</p>
<p>The most common way is to simply put the link next to the text you want
to show as the link. The example below links to this page as a relative
link, meaning the file is in the current folder.</p>
<pre><code>Introducing: [Markdown](markdown.html), the industry-standard format for writing articles!
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Introducing: <a href="markdown.html">Markdown</a>, the industry-standard format for writing articles!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also link to other websites by using the full URL.</p>
<pre><code>Need to [search](https://www.google.com) something?
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Need to <a href="https://www.google.com">search</a> something?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are couple of examples, showing both direct link and separate linking
in the reference.</p>
<pre><code>There are several search engines. Namely [Bing][bing], [Google](http://google.com), and [Yahoo][100].

[bing]: http://bing.com
[100]: http://yahoo.com
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>There are several search engines. Namely <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a>, <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, and <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>If you know how to put links, you know how to put images.</p>
<p>To put an image, just write ‘link’ to your image, and put an exclamation point <code>!</code>
in front of it. Instead of link-text, the text in square brackets will now be the
<code>[alt-text]</code>, that is, texts to display if the image, for some reason, doesn’t load.</p>
<p>Here’s some examples.</p>
<pre><code>This is a link:

[surprised kitty](../img/stock/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-surprised-cat-scottish-straight-closeup-isolated-on-white-background-499196506.jpg)

This is an image:

![surprised kitty](../img/stock/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-surprised-cat-scottish-straight-closeup-isolated-on-white-background-499196506.jpg)

This is an image with text that you can mouse-over.
Go ahead, make it say &quot;Rawrr&quot;

![surprised kitty](../img/stock/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-surprised-cat-scottish-straight-closeup-isolated-on-white-background-499196506.jpg &quot;Rawrr&quot;)
</code></pre><p>And what’s better than putting cats in your websites. Rawwr!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a link:</p>
<p><a href="../img/stock/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-surprised-cat-scottish-straight-closeup-isolated-on-white-background-499196506.jpg">surprised kitty</a></p>
<p>This is an image:</p>

<p><img src="../img/stock/stock-photo-portrait-of-a-surprised-cat-scottish-straight-closeup-isolated-on-white-background-499196506.jpg" alt="surprised kitty" title="Rawrr"></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are useful to convey several information that are
related. There are two types of them: bullet point
and numbered list.</p>
<p>You can use bullet points for describing things that are in parallel,
for example:</p>
<p>Reasons why Markdown is amazing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to read</li>
<li>Simple to write</li>
<li>Good looking</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make bullet points by putting dash (-) and a space in front of the
items like so:</p>
<pre><code>Reasons why Markdown is amazing:
- Easy to read
- Simple to write
- Good looking
</code></pre><p>You can use numbered list to say things in order.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p>How to write:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find ideas</li>
<li>Draft</li>
<li>Write</li>
<li>Spellcheck</li>
<li>Publish</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How would you do that on a Markdown?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Just like on a paper!</p>
<pre><code>How to write:
1. Find ideas
2. Draft
3. Write
4. Spellcheck
5. Publish
</code></pre><h2 id="blockquote">Blockquote</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you might find the need to quote someone else,
either their post, the books they’ve written, etc.</p>
<p>You can do this using Blockquote.</p>
<p>Blockquotes indicates a group of text. This can be done by 
putting the symbol greater-than (<code>&gt;</code>) before the start of the line.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>This is a normal line.

&gt; This is a single line followed by &gt;.

&gt; This paragraph spans
&gt; multiple lines.
</code></pre><p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a normal line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a single line followed by &gt;.</p>
<p>This paragraph spans
multiple lines.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p>How would you put their name inside the Blockquote?
Usually we put a dash (-) before the name, but when we type it like that,</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Doe not panic!
&gt;
&gt; - John Doe
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Doe not panic!</p>
<ul>
<li>John Doe</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>It turns into a bullet point.</p>
<p>To write a literal dash, we type the dash twice (--)</p>
<pre><code>&gt; Doe not panic!
&gt;
&gt; -- John Doe
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p>Doe not panic!</p>
<p>– John Doe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want, you can surround the text with quotation marks <code>&quot;</code> like so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doe not panic!”</p>
<p>– John Doe</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="code-highlighting">Code Highlighting</h2>
<p>You can put codes and have highlighting by using three backticks (```)
followed by the language. Then put your code on a new line. Finally,
end by using three backticks (```).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>```html
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
```
</code></pre><p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
 <span class="nt">&lt;p</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;caption&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Hello<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
</pre></div>

</code></pre>
<p>Please note that language support depends on the highlighting engine
being used. If supported, the engine turns codes into the display format,
for example HTML in its “prettified” form. CSS is usually added so that
the browser shows the code in colors.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That’s the basic of Markdown. Hopefully you can start writing documents
in Markdown, equipped with the knowledge you have now.</p>
