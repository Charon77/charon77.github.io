<p>Back to <a href="index.html#-markdown-markdown-html-">Index</a></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Imagine writing website pages. How would you normally do it? A bunch of
html, links here and there, css files spread all over. What if, maybe some
point in live you decided to use frameworks, such as bootstrap. Things
do not go well, when you have to edit pages after pages one by one, adding
bootstrap css files to each header, assigning classes to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and what-not.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if we can spend more time <strong>actually</strong> write content, and
not figuring out where the closing <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags are?</p>
<p>Markdown solves this problem.</p>
<p>Markdown, on the other hand contains just the document and a few other things;
not much. This is so unlike html documents which contains lots unimportant text
that are not content, but have to be there in order to have <em>nice display</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-">What is it?</h2>
<p>Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
you view it on a browser (like Firefox) or using text editor (like Notepad).
This allows even visitors that uses ancient PCs for <em>surfing the web</em> to access
our website.</p>
<p>Even today, people still favor Markdown for its readability (when viewed as a plain text)
and its simplicity.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a couple of examples.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>A typical html document would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;meta</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;viewport&quot;</span> <span class="na">content=</span><span class="s">&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;link</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;style.min.css&quot;</span><span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;markdown&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Markdown
  <span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;h2</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;what-is-it-&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>What is it?
  <span class="nt">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>

  <span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
  you view it on a browser (think: website) or using text editor.
  This means that you can open any markdown files with programs
  such as notepad, and still be able to read it easily, as opposed
  to reading (.html) files.
  <span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>

<p>If you are familiar with html, you know immediately that what’s really
important is just the heading: <strong><code>Markdown</code></strong>, the sub-heading, <strong><code>What is it?</code></strong>, and
the body of the paragraph surrounded by <code>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Now, let’s compare it to Markdown.</p>
<p>A typical Markdown document looks like this.</p>

What is it?
-----------

Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
you view it on a browser (like Firefox) or using text editor (like Notepad).
This allows even visitors that uses ancient PCs for _surfing the web_ to access
our website.
</code></pre><h2 id="commonly-used-markdown">Commonly used Markdown</h2>
<p>This section is based on <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">this</a> and <a href="https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf">this(pdf)</a>, which are really useful
for starters learning how to use Markdown for the first time.</p>
<p>Other exhaustive Markdown resources are also available, ranging from 
different flavors of Markdown, one of which being gfm (GitHub Flavored Markdown), etc.</p>
<p>Here are some of the basic Markdown example to get started.</p>
<h3 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h3>
<p>A paragraph in Markdown are just text that spans multiple lines, separated by blank lines.
This is useful, as paragraphs tend to be lengthy, and writing a single paragraphs
on a single line would be confusing, especially in times when word-wrapping wasn’t a thing.</p>
<p>A new paragraph is inserted when you insert a blank line, followed by more text.
To illustrate, let’s take a look on these examples.</p>
<pre><code>This section demonstrates paragraphs
that are written
across multiple lines. The quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

This sentence sits on a new paragraph, because of the
empty line that comes before it.
</code></pre><p>This will yield:</p>
<blockquote>

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
<p>This sentence sits on a new paragraph, because of the
empty line that comes before it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
<p>Two main ways of writing headings.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Using # followed by space before the heading.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code># This is heading 1
Some text.
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
...
###### Heading 6
More text!
</code></pre><p>Which yields to:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1 id="this-is-heading-1">This is heading 1</h1>
<p>Some text.</p>
<h2 id="heading-2">Heading 2</h2>
<h3 id="heading-3">Heading 3</h3>
<p>…</p>
<h6 id="heading-6">Heading 6</h6>
<p>More text!</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>Using = or - at the <em>bottom</em> of the heading.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer this method as it looks clearer in plaintext.
You can use this format <strong>only</strong> for Heading 1 and Heading 2. For
levels below it, revert to the # format.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Heading 1
=========    
Some text over here.

Heading 2
----------

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.*
------------

*Note: in some parser, the line below the heading must not be shorter
than the text. This demonstrates what happens when this is violated.
Even though it appears well here, it&#39;s use is discouraged. Besides, it
looks bad.
</code></pre><blockquote>
<h1 id="heading-1">Heading 1</h1>
<p>Some text over here</p>
<h2 id="the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog-">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h2>
<h2 id="the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog-">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</h2>
