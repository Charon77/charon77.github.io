<p>Markdown files (.md) are documents that are easy to view, whether
you view it on a browser (think: website) or using text editor.
This means that you can open any markdown files with programs
such as notepad, and still be able to read it easily, as opposed
to reading (.html) files.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother-">Why bother?</h2>
<p>Imagine writing website pages like how you normally would: a bunch of
html, links here and there, css files spread all over. Then, maybe some
point in live you decided to use frameworks, such as bootstrap. Things
do not go well, when you have to edit pages after pages one by one, adding
bootstrap css files to each header, assigning classes to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and what-not.</p>
<p>It is a nightmare.</p>
<p>Markdown, on the other hand contains just the document and a few other things;
not much. This is so unlike html files.</p>
<p>A normal html files would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.min.css&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1 id=&quot;markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown
  &lt;/h1&gt;

  &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-it-&quot;&gt;What is it?
