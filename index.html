<p>“The Only Difference Between Screwing Around
and Science Is Writing It Down”</p>

<p>We encounter many things in life. 
Yet, a lot of them resides nowhere but in our brains.
Our interaction with people allows us to tell stories of ourselves,
our experiences, our past, values, opinions… the list goes on.</p>
<p>We learn new stuffs, and long as we keep them in our puny brains,
they will dissapear as time goes on. Today, as I write this, marks
the day I, as a person, realises the importance of writing and sharing
knowledge I have with others.</p>
<p>In the following pages, you will find things that I learn so far, mainly
in the field of Computer Science, as well as other things.</p>
<p>I truly wish through these texts, I could shed some lights about
the experiences I encounter as I learn.</p>
